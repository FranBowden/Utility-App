# Codelab 1 Final Project: Utility App

This repository contains my final project for Codelab 1, which is a console-based vending machine application. Users can interact with the application using terminal inputs to manage purchases and view orders.

## Features:
- **Item Selection**: Choose items from a menu with assigned prices and stock using numeric inputs.
- **Order Management**: View the details of selected items and the current order total.
- **Checkout Process**: Complete purchases and receive the correct change based on user input.
- **Change Calculation**: Automatically calculate and return the appropriate change after a purchase.

## Technologies Used:
- **C++**: For implementing the core functionality and handling user interactions in the console.
